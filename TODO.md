## TODO

### TOM
* [ ] - Download and parse cluster of data
* [ ] - Anaylsize feasibility of `metadata` tags for clustering docs and determining aspect-based similarities
* [ ] - Specify DB schema (maybe could do RDF here for flexibility and potential disambiguation to DB-pedia)
* [ ] - Implement function that queries for related groups of articles, given an article and an optional aspect-set
* [ ] - Given group of related articles at server, render these in the popup
